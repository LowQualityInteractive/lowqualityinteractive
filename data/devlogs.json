            "We made a full pass on combat flow between wave 6 and wave 14. Enemy spawn timing now ramps with fewer sudden spikes, so players have more room to react while still being challenged. The intent is to reward cleaner movement and smarter positioning instead of pure luck.",
            "Objective readability has also been improved. Radar pings now use stronger contrast, beacon effects remain visible in heavy particle scenes, and event notifications stay on-screen longer during extraction phases. This should help squads keep track of priorities without stopping to scan the entire HUD.",
            "Progression was tuned so newer players can unlock their first meaningful loadout upgrade sooner. Currency rewards from early contracts were increased, and duplicate drop protection is now stronger when opening supply caches.",
            "Known issue: one arena still has a clipping edge near the upper platform. A hotfix is already in testing and will be shipped in the next micro update."
